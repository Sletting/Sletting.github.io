          A day I was browsing youtube I fell across a video of a drinks
          machine. You selected a drink using a small text-only screen and some
          physical buttons to navigate. It worked by moving a glass on a slider.
          When it reached its destination it raised the glass and a release
          mechanism poured 2cl alcohol into the glass. It slid back and forth,
          raising the glass at every destination until it had combined all the
          needed alcoholic ingredients. When the alcohol had poured it slid to
          one end where it filled it with the desired soda or juice before
          serving it. I loved the concept but my biggest problem with the
          machine was the size and lacking navigation system. It was around 2.5
          meters wide and the navigation system seemed lacking; because of the
          small screen size. I thought to myself “There has to be a better
          solution” and then I started prototyping.

          My goal was to reduce the size to increase the mobility while also
          making it a better user experience. Many of the drinks machines I drew
          inspiration from were based on Arduinos. I wanted my machine to be
          have better UX than the Arduino counterparts and I wanted to show more
          relevant data to the users. Thus I used a Rasperry Pi instead. With
          that I could use a proper screen and it also gave me easier WiFi
          connectivity. I opted for not using a slider that pushes the glass
          against a release mechanism. Instead I used tubes and peristaltic
          pumps to pump liquids into the glass. That way I could drastically
          reduce the size.

          Peristaltic pumps are very precise which is a good
          thing for making drinks. One caveat of using peristaltic pumps were
          that the soda lost all its fizz. To counter that I opted for using a
          different pumping system for soda and juice. I used an air pump to
          pump air into the soda bottle which adds pressure inside the bottle.
          To release the pressure a bigger tube is located at the bottom of the
          bottle, forcing the liquid out of the bottle. When the bottle is full
          its precise enough that you cannot tell two drinks apart. But when the
          bottle is close to empty it takes longer to build up pressure. This is
          something I am still working on refining.

          For interfacing with the
          machine I used a 7" touch screen. The interface was build using
          Angular and Node.JS. Configuration of pumps happens on the machine.
          Here you specify what ingredients you have in your pumps. When the
          ingredients has been specified it will sort the drinks accordingly. It
          only shows drinks that it is able to make and omit all others. To make
          it easy to create new drinks I created a website called
          <a href="https://boozit.dk/">Boozit.dk</a>. Right now the website and
          the drinks machine is not coupled directly together. Meaning that
          there is no mention of the drinks machine on the website. The website
          has an open API where you can search drinks by username and get the
          result in JSON format. That is what the machine uses to get drinks.

          The project took around 1 year to complete with the help from family
          and friends. The machine had its debut at a New Years party in 2020. I
          have several things that I would like to refine including a new
          website for creating drinks, better handling of soda/juice and more
          configuration options. <br>
