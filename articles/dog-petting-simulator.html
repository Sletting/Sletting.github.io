          Dog Petting Simulator Demo was a project I worked on a few years ago
          with a couple of students from The Animation Workshop (TAW), including
          my Sister,
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinasletting/">Kristina</a>.
          As part of their education they had to do a self study. Their group
          wanted to try and make a video game and therefore approached me as
          Kristina and I shared a passion for video games and she knew I had
          programmed a little as part of my education as IT-Supporter.

          It sounded like a fun project so I said yes, asked my boss for
          vacation from work and spend the next three weeks in Viborg living at
          my Sisters working on Dog Petting Simulator. Our team consisted of
          three animators and myself as the programmer. <br />
          We decided to make the game in Unity and after some long evenings and
          lots of coffee we got the demo ready so they could deliver it for
          their exam. We released it on Itch.io and after a few weeks it got
          some traction. The game got downloaded by YouTubers who made
          playthroughs of the game, including
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giK9M1R_MbY">IGN</a>. The
          Guardian also did an article on the popular Twitter user
          <a href="https://twitter.com/CanYouPetTheDog">@CanYouPetTheDog</a>
          where Dog Petting Simulator was

            >showcased.</a
          >
          The game is free to get and can be found on itch.io by
