          Many years ago one of my close friends gave me some wooden coasters
          turned from a tree root. Over the years the surface has become sticky
          and worned down to look at. After watching too many woodworking and
          epoxy videos on YouTube I decided that I wanted to create something
          myself to try it out. The choice fell on creating new coasters for my
          desktop. I've always been fascinated by epoxy resin tables so my goal
          was to incorporate that in the build as well. I started looking online
          after designs to draw inspiration from and stumbled across some 3D
          printed Game of Thrones inspired coasters.

          I've never done much woodwork but luckily I have a brother-in-law who
          is very skilled in woodworking. He helped me choose the wood type and
          cutting the wood. We chose oak for two reasons. It looks really good
          after applying a darkening oil and he had some scraps that I could get
          from free. Being a Northern Jutlander I couldn't pass up getting some
          free wood.

          The Epoxy pour made a mess so a lot of sanding had to be done in order
          to get the surface flat and get the epoxy flush with the wood. After
          sanding the majority with a orbital sander I finished the surfaces up
          with increasingly finer sandpiper. All the way from 220 to 300 to 600
          to 1000 grit.

          When the coasters were sanded I had to decide which oil I wanted to
          finish them with. The choice was between linseed oil which I had
          laying around or Danish oil. The choice landed on Danish oil as it
          should be more water resistant than linseed oil which was a huge plus.
          I bought some and tested it on a scrap piece from the cutting process
          and I was satisfied with the color it brought out in the wood. Next
          step was to apply several coats of oil to the coasters over a few days
          allowing the oil to dry completely between coats. I am extremely
          pleased with the final look and can't wait till they have fully cured.
          <br /><br />Now to make a new coaster holder! <br /><br />
